# Text-to-Handwriting-Tool
A text to handwriting tool developed by me to help people. This is currently a work-in-progress as I am both learning and developing this project at the same time.  
Update 1.0  
I will be using the pillow library to load my custom fonts(which I'll create) and print that on a picture of a blank A4 size paper(to generate realistic effect).  
Update 2.0  .
Successfully managed to draw 5 types of different text onto an image of a blank sheet.
